# sls-spec

This repository contains the current version of the Service Layout Specification.

## Proposing changes

  1.  Open a ticket in this repository with a description of your proposal.  Feel
      free to open a pull request as well if the change is sufficiently straightforward.
  2.  Tag the spec maintainers: currently @markelliot and @gdearment.
  3.  Receive approval from at least two of the three maintainers.  If there is any
      dissent, iterate on the proposal until all parties are satisfied.
  4.  Open a pull request with the appropriate changes (if not already present).  This
      will be merged by one of the specification maintainers.  If the changes
      are not backwards compatible, the version of the specification should be incremented.
  5.  Open tickets or pull requests on projects that implement the specification.  Currently these projects are:
      * [gradle-java-distribution](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-java-distribution)
